# DataBIndingMVVM
DataBindingMVVM Android App

This Android app is a simple demonstration of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture combined with Android Data Binding. It provides a straightforward user interface with a counter and two buttons: "Increment" and "Decrement." The app's primary features include:

1) Displaying a counter value on the screen.
2) Allowing users to increment the counter by pressing the "Increment" button.
3) Allowing users to decrement the counter by pressing the "Decrement" button.
4) The app is structured with a ViewModel to manage the counter's data and uses Android Data Binding to connect the UI elements with the ViewModel. It's an excellent starting point for developers looking to learn about MVVM and data binding in Android app development.

Feel free to use, modify, or learn from this app as a reference for your own Android projects.
